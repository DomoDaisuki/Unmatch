# Unmatch

**Unmatch** is a variant of the *"match 3"* types of games like [Candy Crush](http://candycrushsaga.com/) or [Best Fiends](https://bestfiends.com/) only with a little twist on the subject that instead of matching 3 or more items, you must isolate them from their peers.

###Game Players
- **The game referee**, generating the board and setting up the difficulty with the number of turns the player can play.
- **You** (the player), moving the gems and harvesting them
- Different types of **gems** (undetermined final number, minimum 4)

###Player Goals
- The player must **unmatch (isolate) the gems** to harvest them within a limited number of **turns**.
- To win a level you must **harvest the number of gems specified.**

###Game World
- The **player** must harvest the number of gems specified to **win**.
- If the **player** does not succeed in harvesting enough gems in the limited turns, he **loses**. 
- Each **gem** that is not linked to another similar gem from each direction horizontally, vertically and diagonally is automatically harvested.

###Game Rules
- **The game referee** randomly generates a level for the **player** 
- The **player** must harvest the number of **gems** specified by the game to win.
- The **player** have a specific **number of turns** to finish harvesting your **gems**.
- The game gets harder and harder for **the player** as he must find more **gems** to clear each level.
